Nifty trend: weekly **bearish**, 125-min **up**, 25-min (timing) **up**. Each is up when the close is above its fast average and the fast average above the slow one, down when both are the other way, sideways otherwise (weekly 20/50 weeks; 125-min and 25-min 6/15 candles).

- **Weekly, last 30 min**: `PCR flat · call writing · walls same · mid walls`. New pattern, never seen before. Logged; nothing to go on yet.
  - Writers: `writers even · few weak writers`. Seen 43 times before; Nifty was up after it 46% of the time, average -0.04%. No direction and the walls have not held reliably: no structure.
  - Same, only when the trend was `weekly bearish · 125m up`: Seen 19 times before; Nifty was up after it 56% of the time, average +0.07%. Too few outcomes (18/20) to trade on.
- **Weekly, today vs previous day**: `-`. No pattern yet (needs an earlier snapshot to compare with).
  - Writers: `writers even · few weak writers`. Seen 2 times before; Nifty was up after it 50% of the time, average +0.33%. Too few outcomes (2/20) to trade on.
  - Same, only when the trend was `weekly bearish · 125m up`: Seen 1 times before; Nifty was up after it 100% of the time, average +1.05%. Too few outcomes (1/20) to trade on.
- **Monthly, last 30 min**: `PCR up · put and call writing · walls same · near call wall`. Seen 5 times before; Nifty was up after it 40% of the time, average -0.02%. Too few outcomes (5/20) to trade on.
  - Writers: `writers even · weak calls`. Seen 29 times before; Nifty was up after it 85% of the time, average +0.12%. History points to a bull call debit spread, ATM to about the call wall 24000.

## How to read this
- A pattern is: near-money PCR change · where new OI near the money went · how the put and call walls (biggest OI strikes) moved · where spot sits between the walls.
- A pattern shows a lean only after 10 outcomes, and only when the 95% range of 'up after' sits fully above or below 50%. It points to a structure only after 20 outcomes.
- Every reading is also tagged with the Nifty trend at the time on the weekly chart (10 years of candles) and the 125-min chart, and each pattern is learned again within each trend pair, so a lean that only held in a bearish market shows up as such. The 25-min trend is shown for timing entries but does not split the learning.
- Credit spreads and condors are suggested only after 8+ expiries showed the real move smaller than the straddle priced in (or the walls holding 70%+ of the time); otherwise debit spreads.
- 30-minute patterns from one day move together, so trust a lean more once it has held across several weeks, not one busy day.
- Roughly: common 30-minute patterns reach 20 outcomes in 3 to 6 weeks, day patterns in 3 to 6 months, and the walls/expiry numbers need about 5 months of weekly expiries and a year of monthly ones.
- Walls held means every daily close stayed between the walls; an intraday breach that closed back inside counts as held.
