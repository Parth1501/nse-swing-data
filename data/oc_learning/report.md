## How to read this
- A pattern is: near-money PCR change · where new OI near the money went · how the put and call walls (biggest OI strikes) moved · where spot sits between the walls.
- A pattern shows a lean only after 10 outcomes, and only when the 95% range of 'up after' sits fully above or below 50%. It points to a structure only after 20 outcomes.
- Every reading is also tagged with the Nifty trend at the time on the weekly chart (10 years of candles) and the 125-min chart, and each pattern is learned again within each trend pair, so a lean that only held in a bearish market shows up as such. The 25-min trend is shown for timing entries but does not split the learning.
- Credit spreads and condors are suggested only after 8+ expiries showed the real move smaller than the straddle priced in (or the walls holding 70%+ of the time); otherwise debit spreads.
- 30-minute patterns from one day move together, so trust a lean more once it has held across several weeks, not one busy day.
- Roughly: common 30-minute patterns reach 20 outcomes in 3 to 6 weeks, day patterns in 3 to 6 months, and the walls/expiry numbers need about 5 months of weekly expiries and a year of monthly ones.
- Walls held means every daily close stayed between the walls; an intraday breach that closed back inside counts as held.
